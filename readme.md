# React Project - Comprehensive Implementation

Hi, I am Ruwen, welcome to my React Side Projects! These projects aim to leverage multiple applications to showcase various React concepts such as props, state, useContext, useRef, useReducer, and more!

## Project Features
- **Props**: Learn how to pass data from parent components to child components using props. Understand the concept of prop types and how to validate them.
- **State**: Explore the state management in React and learn how to handle state changes effectively. Understand the difference between props and state.
- **Context**: Dive into the useContext Hook and learn how to manage global state in your React application. Understand the benefits of using context for state management.
- **Ref**: Learn how to use the useRef Hook to access DOM elements or store mutable values. Understand its significance in handling focus, animations, and more.
- **Reducer**: Explore the useReducer Hook and understand how it simplifies state management in complex applications. Learn how to handle multiple state transitions using reducers.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Understand the lifecycle methods in React and how to use them effectively. Learn about componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
- **Components**: Create reusable and modular components to enhance code maintainability and reusability. Understand the concept of composition and separation of concerns.
- **Routing**: Implement routing in your React application using React Router. Understand how to navigate between different pages and handle dynamic routing.
